Shared Dependencies:

1. **Data Schemas**: All files will interact with the same data schemas, which define the structure of the CSV, XLSX, and XLS files. These schemas will include fields for contact information.

2. **File Formats**: All files will need to handle the same file formats: CSV, XLSX, and XLS. 

3. **Error Messages**: The error messages used in input_validation.py, error_handling.py, input_file_verification.py, and exception_handling.py will likely be shared across these files.

4. **Checksum Algorithms**: The checksum algorithms (CRC32, SHA256) used in input_file_verification.py will also be used in security_measures.py for data integrity checks.

5. **Memory Management Techniques**: Techniques for dynamic memory allocation, garbage collection, and resource pooling used in memory_management.py will also be used in resource_management.py.

6. **Performance Metrics**: Metrics for measuring performance used in performance_optimization.py and performance_testing.py will be shared.

7. **Security Measures**: Encryption mechanisms, access controls, and secure coding guidelines used in security_privacy.py will also be used in security_measures.py.

8. **Compatibility Requirements**: Compatibility requirements with different operating systems, file formats, and third-party libraries used in compatibility_testing.py will also be considered in all other files.

9. **Function Names**: Functions for sorting, filtering, and processing data will be shared across multiple files. These might include functions like sort_data(), filter_data(), process_data(), etc.

10. **Shared Libraries**: Libraries for handling CSV, XLSX, and XLS files, performing checksums, managing memory, optimizing performance, ensuring security, and testing compatibility will be shared across multiple files.

11. **Shared Variables**: Variables like input_file, processed_data, error_log, performance_metrics, security_settings, and compatibility_issues might be shared across multiple files.

12. **Shared Constants**: Constants like SUPPORTED_FILE_FORMATS, MAX_FILE_SIZE, MAX_MEMORY_USAGE, PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD, SECURITY_LEVEL, and COMPATIBILITY_LIST might be shared across multiple files.
